## Overview

`Teesee` is a simple web application that allows you to visualize and compare total compensation packages over time. Offers can be confusing to understand and compare: multiple parameters, different vesting schedule, different benefits, etc.

All offers are ultimately different but they usually all follow a common structure and use the same *ingredients*. `Teesee` breaks down the offer into several part (most of them are not mandatory):

- Base salary: this is cash you receive every month.
- Benefits: this is your health insurance, 401k match, paid time-off, your free *whatever*. It is not cash but still has a monetary value.
- Sign-on bonuses: this is a cash amount unlocked over the year (every month for example). Offers can include several of those and it is a way to sweeten an offer.
- Initial stock grant: this is not a cash amount, but a number of shares that will vest over a period of time. The vesting schedule differs from company to company. Again, this is not a cash amount per se, but has monetary value if you were to sell those shares.
- Performance cash: this is a cash amount that is usually indexed on both your past year's work and the level you are operating at. It usually happens every year.
- Performance stock refresher: this can be another part of the performance rewards. It comes as a stock grant with a vesting schedule that can be different from the initial stock grant. This also usually happens every year.
